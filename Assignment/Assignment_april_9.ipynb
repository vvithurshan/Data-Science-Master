    "### Q1. What is Bayes' theorem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is a fundamental theorem in probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event. It is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What is the formula for Bayes' theorem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Bayes' theorem is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( P(A|B) \\) is the posterior probability, the probability of event A occurring given that event B is true.\n",
    "- \\( P(B|A) \\) is the likelihood, the probability of event B occurring given that event A is true.\n",
    "- \\( P(A) \\) is the prior probability, the initial probability of event A.\n",
    "- \\( P(B) \\) is the marginal likelihood, the total probability of event B occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. How is Bayes' theorem used in practice?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is used in various fields such as machine learning, statistics, medicine, and finance to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. Some common applications include:\n",
    "- Spam filtering\n",
    "- Medical diagnosis\n",
    "- Predictive modeling\n",
    "- Risk assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What is the relationship between Bayes' theorem and conditional probability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is a direct consequence of the definition of conditional probability. Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred. Bayes' theorem uses conditional probabilities to update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. How do you choose which type of Naive Bayes classifier to use for any given problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of which type of Naive Bayes classifier to use depends on the nature of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Used when the features are continuous and normally distributed.\n",
    "- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: Used for discrete data such as word counts in text classification problems.\n",
    "- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**: Used for binary/boolean features, where features are binary (0/1 or True/False).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. Assignment: Naive Bayes Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- X1 = 3\n",
    "- X2 = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Frequency Table:\n",
    "| Class | X1=1 | X1=2 | X1=3 | X2=1 | X2=2 | X2=3 | X2=4 |\n",
    "|-------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n",
    "| A     | 3    | 3    | 4    | 4    | 3    | 3    | 3    |\n",
    "| B     | 2    | 2    | 1    | 2    | 2    | 2    | 3    |\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume equal prior probabilities for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate the prior probabilities**:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(A) = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(B) = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate the likelihoods**:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(X1=3 | A) = \\frac{4}{3+3+4} = \\frac{4}{10} = 0.4\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(X2=4 | A) = \\frac{3}{4+3+3+3} = \\frac{3}{13} \\approx 0.2308\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(X1=3 | B) = \\frac{1}{2+2+1} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(X2=4 | B) = \\frac{3}{2+2+2+3} = \\frac{3}{9} = 0.3333\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate the marginal likelihood** (not needed for class comparison since it's the same for both):\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(X1=3, X2=4)\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the posterior probabilities**:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(A | X1=3, X2=4) \\propto P(X1=3 | A) \\cdot P(X2=4 | A) \\cdot P(A)\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(A | X1=3, X2=4) \\propto 0.4 \\cdot 0.2308 \\cdot 0.5 = 0.0462\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(B | X1=3, X2=4) \\propto P(X1=3 | B) \\cdot P(X2=4 | B) \\cdot P(B)\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(B | X1=3, X2=4) \\propto 0.2 \\cdot 0.3333 \\cdot 0.5 = 0.0333\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Since \\( P(A | X1=3, X2=4) > P(B | X1=3, X2=4) \\), Naive Bayes would predict the new instance to belong to class A."
