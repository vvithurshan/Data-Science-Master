It works by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent of the objective function. In machine learning problems, it is commonly used to minimize the error of a model by iteratively adjusting the parameters of the model in the direction of steepest descent of the error function. Therefore, the optimal values for the parameters, which yield the minimum error, can be found."

    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of polynomial regression compared to linear regression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Overfitting: Polynomial regression can easily overfit the data if a high-order polynomial is used. This can lead to poor generalization to new data.\n",
