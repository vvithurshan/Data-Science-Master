Traditional web hosting has a limited amount of resources. However, cloud hosting has wide range of computational resources. For traditional web hosting serivices, web site owners pay fixed amount monthly while for cloud hosting it is based on the usage. Cloud hosting is more simplified for hosting, security, reliable, scalable, and flexible compared to conventional web hosting services."
