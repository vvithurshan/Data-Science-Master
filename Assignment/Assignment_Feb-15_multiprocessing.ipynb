    "3. Multiprocessing is faster for tasks which can be divided into independent subtasks. Multithreading is faster on tasks that wait for other task to complete. \n",
    "4. Since multiprocessing use many independent processes, generally it is difficult to implementation and debug than multithreading.\n",
    "5. Multiprocessing has many separate processes. Therefore, it has a higher overhead due to the need to manage and communicate between different processes. However, multithreading has lower overhead as it does not need to create and manage multiple processes. "

Each process runs a function with a different input, which can improve the performance of the task when working with a large number of inputs. The pool object manages these processes and allows the programmer to easily create and manage them in Python. By using a pool of processes, the program can take advantage of the available hardware resources, such as multiple cores or CPUs, to speed up the execution of the program"
