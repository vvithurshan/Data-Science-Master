    "Lasso regression is a type of regression that performs both feature selection and regularization. It aims to improve the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the model by shrinking some of the coefficients to zero and excluding from the model. Therefore, it helps to reduce the problem due to overfitting and multicollinearity that occurs in oridal least square regression."

    "Tunning parameter that can affect the Lasso regression is lambda. It controls the strength of the regularization, which is the absolute value of the coefficient multiplied by lambda. When lambda is very low, the regularization term becomes zero and the Laso regression becomes a normal regression. Similarly, when it is very high, the coefficient of all features become zero, making the model very simple. Therefore, the tunning parameter labmda affects the trade-off between bias and variance. "

For this to be used, one can use kernel methods to map the predictor variables x to a higher-dimensional feature space where they may be more linearly related to y. Then one can apply lasso regression in the feature space to select and regularize the coefficients."

Ridge regeression is mainly used to reduce overfitting of the model, whereas Lasso regression is mainly used for the features selection process. "
