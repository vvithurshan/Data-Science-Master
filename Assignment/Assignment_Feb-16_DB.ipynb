It is suitable for applications that require atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability, and stability. While NOSQL, on other hand, is based on non-relational data model. It stores data in various ways like document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph database. It uses mongoDB Query Language(MQL) to manipulate and manage data. It is designed to scale horizontally and handle large volumes of unstructured data. It is suitable for applications that require high availability, scalability, and flexibility."
