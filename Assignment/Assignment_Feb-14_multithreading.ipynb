    "Multithreading is the ability of a program to run multiple threads simultaneously without waiting for other tasks to complete. It is used to achieve concurrency in a program. For instance, if a program (without multithreading) takes a long time to complete one calculation, other independent tasks have to wait until it finishes, resulting in a longer processing time. Multithreading avoids this issue by running multiple threads at the same time. <br>\n",
