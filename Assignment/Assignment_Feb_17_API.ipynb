    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Standardization - API proives standardized way for a developer of one application to get the service or access the details prvided by other application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simplification - With the help of API, developers are easily able to implement some complex featuers that need a lot time to build in their applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability - It can be used to scale to large numbers of user requests without requiring additional resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Innovation - With the help of API developers are able to build the applications that contain some interesting services provided by other applications. Therefore, developers are able do some innovations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dependency - If some features of the application are implemented using APIs, then the application is hugely dependent on the availability of the APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Security - If application is using API, sometimes the application may be vulnerable to some attacks by hackers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cost - Some APIs are very expensive to implement."
